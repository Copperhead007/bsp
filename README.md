This is a Binary Space Partition Program to generate a Tile Map
It uses Random generation based off of known information height and width sizes. Furthermore the splitting process can be ran a reasonable number of kTimes. If you play with it please make sure to adjust the size of the map accordingly or else it may fail.
Current implementation has rooms. I am working to connect all rooms with a paths algorithm.
